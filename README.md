# Virtual Reality Training for Drum

Final project for VR Fundemantal

# Abstract

This project will help users learn how to play drum kit. User can follow the lessons in this project and build up the basic knowledge and technique of playing drum kit. User can learn how to play the drum kit in an interactive and interesting way. This application can also help people practice drumming skills. I made this project as real as possible to make sure that after training on VR, user can also easily play on real drum kit.

# Design

There two section in this project. The lesson section and the practice section. In the lesson section, there are three lessons now. The first lesson will teach user about the basic notation and the drum kit setting. Users can hit the drum to get more detail information. Just as Figure 1 shows. The second lesson will teach user how to play along with the metronome in a stable speed. The third lesson will teach the user how to play a simple drum rhythm pattern called ”disco”. In lesson two and three, users will have to set the speed, follow the example, and check on the score in the end of lesson. The interface of lesson two and three is shown at Figure 2 and Figure 3. Last, there is a practice section. In this section, user can practice with metronome and set the speed with slider. Moreover, they can also play songs and practice. Figure 4 shows how it looks like.

# Conclusions

This project is only a prototype. In the future, First, I want to add a paddle for this project to simulate the real bass drum paddle. This will help the user to get more familiar with the real drum kit. Second, I will add more lesson to the project to teach more drum rhythm pattern and also teach how to count more difficult beat. Lastly, I want to improve the practice section. I will add functions for users to upload their own music sheet and song, so they can practice with anything they want. Moreover, I want to add a record function, so they can check their practice result, or even record their own drum rhythm pattern with this function. In summary, I hope this application will help those who wants to start learning drum kit and also let the users enjoy the music.
